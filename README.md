# Chess Sphere

Chess Sphere is an interactive chess platform that allows players to play chess against each other in real-time. It tracks the game state, updates the chessboard, and checks for game completion (win condition). The game is built using **React** for the UI and **Redux** for managing the game state, which keeps track of the chess pieces, their positions, and whether the game has been won.
